            <h3>Project Two Story:</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                A client contacted me on Freelancer.com asking for me to build them a website. Of course business is business, so we
                accepted the offer. We need to find out if we need to use PHP and/or JavaScript, so we can hire two more people. If we
                do need PHP and/or JavaScript then we need to decide if we need to hire a PHP expert, JavaScript Expert or both. Last
                but not least we then finish the project.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Theme Reasoning:</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                I chose this theme because not only do I love Web Design and Development. I am also learning to love programming. 
                I have tried learning CSharp, one time in the past for a certain job position. Although the employer cancelled the 
                project and chose not to hire me. Therefore I had no desire or reason to know CSharp, so I stopped studying. Come to
                realize in the future I could have greatly benifited from it.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                The other reason why I had chose this theme is because this is a real life term that happens to be in a weekly basis.
                I get hired by other people on Freelancer to build them a website. Sometimes it requires JavaScript or a Server Side Language.
                Although I am not fluent enough to build a website using a lot of JavaScript or a Server Side Language. Therefore I have to
                hire someone to do that work for me.
